# Clarified Moon

Using softwares Firecapture and Photoshop, we take down photos from all over China for 2 months, and then stack them together through Photoshop, and get a final clarified photo.

Because of the limit of uploading files, we can just display one full cycle of moon phase. For more photos taken, contact [me](yintianshu@qq.com).
